While a growing body of research has examined the effects of remote work on productivity, labour market outcomes, and well-being, its impact on political outcomes remains largely unexplored. This paper tests two competing theoretical frameworks to assess how working from home (WFH) affects electoral participation. According to the resource model, WFH should increase participation by expanding time availability and improving organisational skills. In contrast, socialisation theory suggests that reduced formal and informal workplace interactions under WFH weaken political participation. Using longitudinal data from the Dutch LISS panel (2008â€“2024), I employ an event-study difference-in-differences design with staggered treatment assignment to estimate the causal effects of WFH on political participation. The results reveal a negative effect of WFH on voting, indicating that remote work erodes workplace-based socialisation and, in turn, lowers civic engagement. This paper contributes to the literature of technological change in the workplace and the growing literature on the social consequences of remote work. These findings highlight the need to consider democratic implications in the design of future work-arrangement policies.
