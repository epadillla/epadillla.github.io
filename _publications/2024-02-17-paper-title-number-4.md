Authoritarian elites may play an essential role in transitioning democracies, but little is known about the fate of these elites beyond that of the top leaders. This article offers the first panel-data study of authoritarian elites in a transitional democracy. We focus on Spain, a paradigmatic case of successful democratization from above, and rely on an original dataset to measure quantitatively the professional careers of more than 600 members of the Francoist elites in Spain. We have measured the relative importance of each job that members of Francoist elites had before and after the democratization process, gathering information on more than 5,400 jobs over 50 years. Our results suggest a positive relationship between the individualâ€™s position during the dictatorship and the democracy. While there was a change in the importance of Francoist political elites after the transition, economic elites were barely affected by the transition to democracy. For that reason, natural death and retirement were the most common reasons behind their disappearance from the spheres of power.
