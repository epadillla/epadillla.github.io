I am a second-year PhD Candidate in Political Science at the [Universitat de Barcelona](https://web.ub.edu/es/inicio) and a researcher at the [AI-PSR](http://aipsr.net/) group. üìç This Spring 2025, I am visiting Humboldt-Universit√§t zu Berlin. Let's grab a coffee if you are around ‚òï.

My thesis project focuses on the political economy of AI and working from home. I am particularly interested in how these technological shocks have impacted the labour market and how such impacts translate into political behaviour and attitudes.

Before starting my PhD, I worked as an RA at the Universitat Pompeu Fabra. I hold a BA in Political Science and Public Administration from the Universitat de Val√®ncia and a Research Master in Political Science from the Universitat Pompeu Fabra.

I am interested in comparative politics, political behaviour, and political economy. Additionally, I closely follow the methodological debates in the social sciences, particularly those surrounding causal inference and computational social science.
